3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set



4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

# Take out mean and std for each measurement
## What are the columns

# Name activities in data set (y)
## Use activities file 

# label dataset variables with good names
## use features file to identify columns

# Create new tidy data set with average of each variable for each activity and each subject
